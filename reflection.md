What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This project was very very difficult for me, I went to TA hours twice and I still didn't really understand what to do. Add computer and print inventory works. However, refurbish doesn't work. The advice I'd give someone taking this course in the future is to make sure you go to class with some background information whether it's the topic of the day or just Java in general.
